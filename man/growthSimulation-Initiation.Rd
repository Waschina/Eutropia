\title{Initialise a growth simulation.}
\usage{
init.simulation(
  universePolygon,
  gridFieldSize = 1,
  gridFieldLayers = 3,
  deltaTime = 1/6,
  diffusion.alpha = 6/7,
  diffusion.niter = 60,
  pFBAcoeff = 1e-06,
  rMotion = 1/6,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{universePolygon}{A two column matrix specifiying the x and y coordinates of the polygon, that describes the growth environment boundaries.}

\item{gridFieldSize}{double. Distance between neighboring environments 3D mesh field elements (rhombic dodecahedrons) in µm.}

\item{gridFieldLayers}{integer. z-dimension (height) as the number of layers of field elements.}

\item{deltaTime}{double specifying the length of each time step for the simulation in hours.}

\item{diffusion.alpha}{double. This number should be between 0 and 1 and specifies the rate of naive diffusion, but specifying the fraction of compound in a field that is equally distributed to the neighboring fields. Default: 12/13.}

\item{diffusion.niter}{integer. Number of diffusion steps per simulation round.}

\item{pFBAcoeff}{integer. pFBA coefficient. Default: 1e-6}

\item{rMotion}{double. Maximum x- and y distance a cell can travel by means of random movement per minute. Default: 1/6 µm}
