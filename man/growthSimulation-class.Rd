\title{Structure of the S4 class "growthSimulation"}
\description{
Structure of the S4 class \code{growthSimulation} as framework
for the growth environment and container for agent-based flux balance
analysis.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{n_rounds}}{integer for the number of simulation rounds that were already
performed for this \code{growthSimulation} object.}

\item{\code{deltaTime}}{double for length of each time step for the simulation in
hours.}

\item{\code{rMotion}}{double. Maximum x- and y distance a cell can travel by means of
random movement per simulation round. Unit: Âµm per minute.}

\item{\code{models}}{List for \link{Organism} objects to represent the different
strains in the simulation.}

\item{\code{history}}{list with recordings of simulation status information at each
simulation round.}

\item{\code{cellDT}}{Data table with individual cell information (e.g. size,
position, velocity, type)}

\item{\code{universePolygon}}{Matrix specifying the corners of the polygon that
defines the growth environment boundaries. 2-dimensional: x and y.}

\item{\code{environ}}{Object of S4-class \link{growthEnvironment}, that specifies the
environment mesh layout, compounds, and their concentrations.}
