\title{Plot spatial distribution of compounds}
\usage{
plot.environment(
  object,
  compounds,
  compound.names = NULL,
  xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{S4-object of type \code{growthSimulation}.}

\item{compounds}{Character string of compound ids to plot}

\item{compound.names}{Character string of compound names that should be displayed as facet header instead of compound names from the simulation object.}

\item{xlim}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the limits (left and right) for x axis; i.e. the horizontal dimension.}

\item{ylim}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the limits (top and bottom) for y axis; i.e. the vertical dimension.}

\item{iter}{Positive integer number of the simulation step/iteration to plot the distribution. Works only if the respective metabolite
concentrations were prior recorded (see \code{link{run.simulation}}). If \code{NULL}, current distribution of compound concentrations.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Plots the spatial distribution of compound concentrations in a heatmap.
